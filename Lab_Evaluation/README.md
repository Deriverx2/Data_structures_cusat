#**21-805-0206: Data Structures Lab Evaluation I**
1. Implement a recursive merge sort in C++, to sort _n_ given integers.
2. Let A be an array containing N integers, with the irst n of them being positive and the rest being negative. Give an algorithm to find n in _O(log N)_. Can you find a solution in _O(log n)_?
3. Give an array, arr[0..n-1 ] of distinct elements and a range [low, high], find all numbers that are in a range, but not the array. The missing elements should be printed in sorted order.

**Input:**  arr[] = { 10, 12, 11, 15}, low = 10, high = 15

**Output:**  13, 14

**Input:**  arr[] = { 1, 14, 11, 51, 15}, low = 50, high = 55

**Output:**  50, 52, 53, 54, 55
